<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>My Living City is an application that is used to connect people with ideas about how to improve the com- munity to those that share similar passions and want to make a change. My Living City project is to add moderator functionality to the pre-existing application. Moderation is of utmost importance when trying to reach successful and genuine collaboration. Malicious actors and bots must be able to be dealt with swiftly. By implementing this, MLC can safely create a geo-located dialogue of likeminded people.</p>
