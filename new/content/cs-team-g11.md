# Team G11 | Checkfront API Data Migration

## Project

Checkfront is a booking platform that aims to streamline reservations for both businesses and customers, supporting reservations in areas such as tours, activities, rentals, and accommodations. 

This project aims to encourage clients of Checkfront’s booking platform to migrate their existing data to the latest version 4 software. By migrating, clients receive access to the latest features and allow Checkfront to better focus their efforts on maintaining their latest software. Thus, Checkfront has tasked team G11 with a data migration application that would take in customer data from Checkfront’s version 3 API and convert it into a format compatible with their version 4 API.
