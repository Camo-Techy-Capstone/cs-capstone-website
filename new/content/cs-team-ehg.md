# Team EHG

## Sponsor

Cuboh is a company based in Victoria that offers restaurants a way to aggregate their delivery apps and manage menus, schedule pickups and handle transactions all on one device.

## Project

Our project, A Superb Menu Rater (ASMR), aims to improve the functionality of Cubohâ€™s existing web application, which allows potential clients to input links to their menus, creates graded reports on the menus, sends the reports to the user via email, and generates leads for Cuboh.

Hudson has always had an interest in complex problem solving and a curiosity for computer sciences. This has led to him developing a high level of persistence and patience to give him a strong basis to apply to practical skills. Hudson has a solid foundation of knowledge in the computer science field but is still eager to learn and take on new challenges. The ICS program has given Hudson the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment where he has learned to develop his skill in helping and communicating with his peers.
