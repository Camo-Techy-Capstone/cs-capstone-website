# Team Cranky Goose

## Introduction

Team Cranky Goose is working with our sponsor, Ben Leather, to develop the 3Trees Membership and Royalty System (3TreesMRS).

## Project

3 Trees recognized the challenge for businesses of managing members and royalties for content creators and artists. Three Trees Membership and Royalty System is a web application created to connect people with the vast pool of media production talent in the greater Victoria area. The goal of the site is to encourage media talent to sign up to create a pool of users that can be searched through by producers looking to acquire talent for their projects. Secondly, another main aim of the application will be to implement a system for dividing revenue accurately among those involved, ensuring everyone who worked on a project is paid fairly and accurately, while reducing administrative overhead.

Jackie grew up on Vancouver island and enjoys everything this island has to offer, from camping to kayaking. Though her greatest passion comes from tinkering around with technology and solving problems. She finished a Bachelor’s degree of Philosophy in 2009 but realized this career path did not align well with her true passion leading her to complete the ICS program at Camosun College. Where she arrived at the goal of finding work being an Oracle DBA.

Alex Cartwright grew up in Canmore, Alberta. After moving to Victoria in 2010, he attended the University of Victoria (Uvic) on a golf scholarship and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology. Following his time at Uvic, he worked a few years as a groundskeeper at Victoria Golf Club. Despite his love for the outdoors, he recognized he needed to pursue a new, more relevant career path. After doing some research, he opted to enroll into the Information and Computer Systems program at Camosun College. He soon developed a new passion for computer science, specifically the problem-solving aspect of it. So far during the program, web app development and software development are two career paths he is most interested in with the ultimate goal of becoming a full-stack developer.

David is a 29 year old student who is pursuing an education in Computer Science. A man of few words and not a fan of writing about himself. Prefers to have actions and deeds speak instead of words. Is an adult who has led and dealt with many issues in his early life. Every challenge, both from within and out, has resulted in becoming a stronger and more diverse individual. Has a thirst for knowledge and the unknown. He goes forth to explore and experience as much as possible to gain a deeper understanding of the world and the things within it. He’s risked and will continue to risk sanity in the pursuit of this goal. “We are all given (freely or not) a life and it is our choice to use it as we see fit.” For David it's to do everything in his life; to make this world a better place than he was born in.
