## Project

Our project's goal is to automatically sauce various sizes of pizza with high repeatability. Our machine is capable of applying sauce to pizzas that are between 8-16 inches. Each pizza can be sauced within 10-30 seconds. This project is the first stage of a multi-stage project that our client has created with the intent to create a machine that can automatically create pizzas in preexisting or new restaurants.
