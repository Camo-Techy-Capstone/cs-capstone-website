# Team Burg

## Project

Burg was tasked with improving NAAS Foods’ current production process for their line of kelp cube supplements and completing a press for Keltsmaht’s fertilizer production. Both projects aim to cutback on intensive labour and assist in the creation of profitable product lines.
