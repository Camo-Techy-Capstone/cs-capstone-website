<p>The Spinaline is a seat insert with an adjustable profile, designed to fit to a user’s back, improve their posture, and prevent chronic back pain. Jacana Industries’ task is to modify the Spinaline so it can be mounted to most common wheelchairs, as well as normal chairs, office chairs, and vehicle seats.</p>

We would like to thank Sacral Solutions, our client, for inventing a product so beneficial to people’s health and for giving us an opportunity to gain real-world experience (e.g. holding meetings, ordering supplies, and managing communications), as well as our instructors, for guiding us through the trickier parts of the Capstone project.</p></div></div>
