<h1 id="teamg11checkfrontapidatamigration">Team G11 | Checkfront API Data Migration</h1>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>Checkfront is a booking platform that aims to streamline reservations for both businesses and customers, supporting reservations in areas such as tours, activities, rentals, and accommodations. </p>
<p>This project aims to encourage clients of Checkfront’s booking platform to migrate their existing data to the latest version 4 software. By migrating, clients receive access to the latest features and allow Checkfront to better focus their efforts on maintaining their latest software. Thus, Checkfront has tasked team G11 with a data migration application that would take in customer data from Checkfront’s version 3 API and convert it into a format compatible with their version 4 API.</p>
