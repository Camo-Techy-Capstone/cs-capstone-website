		<h2 id="introduction" class="bold">Introduction</h2>
		<p class="bottomSpace">Our group, SigmaBrains has been tasked with creating a historical forest cover map converter for NFIS. The concept of this project is to examine certain sections from a scanned, hand-drawn, forest cover map and use the information to create analysis-ready data, which can then be utilized in modeling, simulations and coverage reports from a specific time.</p>
		<h2 id="project" class="bold">Project</h2>
		<p class="bottomSpace">The purpose of the tool is to remove distinct dot-dashed lines which make up regions on the map and convert them into polygon-shaped regions. In addition, the labels for the areas enclosed by the dot-dashed lines on the maps are recognized and extracted as meaningful data.</p>
