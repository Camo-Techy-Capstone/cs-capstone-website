		<p class="bottomSpace">New members of BC government teams need a platform for curated resources that are easy to locate, comment on, and discuss. Currently there are a number of different tools that fill parts of the identified need which leads to more duplication and over time a lack of use and orphaned information. The goal of the CITZ Co-op/Capstone 2022 Hybrid-Workplace project team is to create a modern web application as a tool for communities to collaborate.</p>
