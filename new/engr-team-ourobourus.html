<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>Shawnigan Village WaterWorks is a potable water treatment facility which services over 500 homes in the Shawnigan Village area. The first stage of filtration is a 50-micron filter to remove larger particulates in the lake water. We have developed a device which automatically cleans these filters, saving our client up to 10 hours per week. Our solution involves an array of solenoid-controlled nozzles and filter actuation to get the job done as efficiently as possible.</p>

We would like to thank our sponsor Rod Lidstone for trusting us with his project, entertaining our ideas and always being willing to help when asked. This has been a fantastic and educational project that we are grateful to have been a part of.</p></div></div>
