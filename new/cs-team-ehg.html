		Hudson has always had an interest in complex problem solving and a curiosity for computer sciences. This has led to him developing a high level of persistence and patience to give him a strong basis to apply to practical skills. Hudson has a solid foundation of knowledge in the computer science field but is still eager to learn and take on new challenges. The ICS program has given Hudson the opportunity to work in a collaborative environment where he has learned to develop his skill in helping and communicating with his peers.
