<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Totem Rotisserie is designed to revolutionize the totem carving process. By introducing a machine that facilitates sustainable totem carving from second-growth timbers, Ancestral Alliance Engineering hopes the need for old growth totems will be a thing of the past. Most importantly, it will be of great benefit to the Indigenous community by serving as a form of cultural revitalization. </p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>Our product, a modular lifting, rotating, and milling machine will not only be safe to use but easily adjustable. What is more, because the Totem Rotisserie will make totem carving more accessible, it will assist Elders (Knowledge Keepers) to continue carving and passing down their cultural traditions and knowledge to future generations. This will help to revive the totem carving tradition by inspiring younger generations to practice it in a more sustainable way. </p>
