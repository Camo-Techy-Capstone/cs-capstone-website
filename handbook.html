      <h2 class="mainText">Overview</h2>
      <p>The course offers a meaningful learning experience to our students and allows our valued industry partners to tap into the resources and talents of our students. This presents an excellent opportunity for organizations to develop and recruit talented new graduates with company-specific knowledge.</p>
      <p>Over a period of four months, our second-year students work in teams on projects proposed by a variety of organizations. For four months, they will analyze, design and implement a software solution for an industry partner. Most projects are completed by the end of August. Students may work off-site, at your organization, during the project.</p>
      <p>In addition to you, the sponsor, an instructor in the Computer Science Department serves as an advisor for the student team.</p>
      <div class="cleaner h20"></div>
      <h2 >Capstone Project</h2>
      An ideal Capstone Project will have the following attributes:
      <ul>
        <li>The domain of the project falls within the broad spectrum of software development. Projects in unique or specialized areas are especially encouraged. </li>
        <li>Students are responsible for most of the analysis and design decisions. This is an opportunity for students to learn project management skills as well as to apply knowledge gained in systems analysis and software engineering courses. The sponsor may enforce reasonable constraints, especially when the project involves integration to a current system. </li>
        <li>A workload should be sufficient for a team of 2 – 4 students. </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="cleaner h20"></div>
      <h2 >Student Skills</h2>
      <p> Students take the full set of courses in the <a href="http://camosun.ca/learn/programs/information-computer-systems/" target="_blank">Information and Computer Systems Technology</a> or <a href="http://camosun.ca/learn/programs/interactive-media-developer/" target="_blank"> Interactive Media Developer </a>Program</p>
      <p>By the start of Capstone you should expect students to be knowledgeable in: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Program, deploy, secure and maintain software applications to meet requirements. </li>
        <li> Apply knowledge of common operating systems and software applications to troubleshoot and provide customer support. </li>
        <li> Design, analyze, maintain and interpret data to manage information effectively. </li>
        <li> Retrieve, store and maintain data in keeping with industry and sponsor standards. </li>
        <li> Apply knowledge of basic project management skills to information technology activities. </li>
        <li> Work as part of a team to communicate and collaborate   effectively with colleagues, team members, employers and technical and   non-technical personnel. </li>
        <li> Demonstrate professional and ethical responsibility in the information technology field and workplace. </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="cleaner h20"></div>
      <h2 >The Process</h2>
      <p> After a project is submitted, it will   be reviewed for appropriateness --- size, content, and so forth. If the   review committee feels a submitted project does not meet the necessary   criteria, but would be well received by the students, the sponsor will   be given the opportunity to modify the proposal or withdraw it. </p>
      <p>Once the project is accepted, a forum   meeting will be set up at the College with all the sponsors and all   student teams. Each sponsor will briefly present their project proposal   to the group. After the presentation, sponsors will meet with each   student team for 10 minutes to discuss the project. We often compare   this process to speed dating for a project. At the end of the forum, the   sponsors will be requested to provide the Capstone project course   instructor their top three teams. Students will also provide the   instructor with their top three project choices. </p>
      <p>The committee reviews the matches. Once a   decision has been made that the team and the project are a good match,   the sponsors are contacted for approval of the suggested team. Should   the sponsor feel that there is no team suitable for their project the   submission may be withdrawn. </p>
      <div class="cleaner h20"></div>
      <h2 >Sponsor Requirements</h2>
      <p> In order to be a successful Capstone   Project, a sponsor must be prepared to work with faculty and students to   complete the project. </p>
      <p>We require the following from Capstone Sponsors: </p>
      <p> A proposal providing an outline of the   organization&rsquo;s problem, question, and/or goals. It may also include   additional deliverables that are needed by the sponsors. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> A primary contact who will serve as the project liaison.   This person will be the key communication point for faculty members and   student teams&rsquo; members. </li>
        <li> During the first phase of the project, work will be done on   campus and will not require students to be present at the sponsor&rsquo;s   work site unless there is a mutually agreeable time and space available.    During the second phase of the project, implementation may take place   on campus or at the sponsor&rsquo;s work site. </li>
        <li> Provide appropriate support for students such as access to data, stakeholders and providing timely feedback. </li>
        <li> Provide timely feedback to the student team and, if necessary, the faculty advisor. </li>
        <li> Provide any software or hardware not available at the College. </li>
        <li> Complete a team evaluation upon completion of each phase. </li>
        <li> Be available for the final presentation and showcase at the end of June. </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="cleaner h20"></div>
      <h2 >Timeline</h2>
      <p> <strong>ICS 280: Winter Term (January to April). </strong></p>
      <p>Students form project teams, prepare   resumes or portfolios and review approved projects. A team may put   forward their own project sponsor, as long as the project gets approved   by the Computer Science Department using the same review process and   deadlines as all project submissions. During this term, the students   will also create a Project Charter as a kick off for the project. </p>
      <p><strong>ICS 290: Summer Term (May to August) </strong></p>
      <p>The project groups will focus a majority   of their time on the project through gathering requirements and   implementation. Students are also preparing for their final Capstone   Symposium Showcase that will take place during August. </p>
      <p>Students typically need to meet with and/or talk to sponsors and stakeholders at least once per week throughout this process. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>January: Project Requests are made. Project Teams are formed</li>
        <li> February: The meet and great between prospective sponsors and project teams.</li>
        <li> March: Final confirmation of match between sponsor and teams.</li>
        <li> April: Completion of Project Charter.</li>
        <li> May – July: Project requirement gathering and implementation.</li>
        <li> August: Capstone Symposium and project wrap-up.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="cleaner h20"></div>
      <h2 >Confidentiality</h2>
      <p> All project products produced by   students are placed under public domain with the College. We do not   require the students to enter into any non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or   sign away their intellectual property (IP) rights. </p>
      <p>If you require a formal Intellectual   Property agreement with Camosun College and students, please indicate in   the Project Submission Form. Any Intellectual Property Agreement will:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider Capstone group members as co-creators; </li>
        <li> Allow students to write a report and make presentations to Professors and peers for grading purposes;  </li>
        <li>Allow students to include a project description in their resume or work portfolio; </li>
        <li>Not exclude students from seeking employment in the given industry; </li>
        <li> Allow a short summary of the project to be published on the   website and media releases to exhibit student work. Certain details may   be left out at the sponsor&rsquo;s request. </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="cleaner h30"></div>
